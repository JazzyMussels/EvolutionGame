# Evolution!

## Description
This is a game where you begin life as a little egg. As you quash bugs, you hatch into a chicken. You continue to grow until you become a powerful Over Lord. Beware! If you get hit, you return to being that little egg. But that's okay, it's best to live life with the mindset of a consummate beginner.
